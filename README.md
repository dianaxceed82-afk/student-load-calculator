I want coding to create a simple calculator based on givens of the total student hours available or not available and scenario of relaxed total availability of 40 hours a week, average of 60 hours a week and strict of 80 hours a week, remaining hours and dividing this by 12 hours per course recommending ultimately the number of courses per term. Student assessment first draft for discussion: Audience: Students. Your responses describe typical weekly commitments outside of class. They help us tailor your course load so you can succeed without overloading your schedule. The advisor will use these numbers to recommend a balanced plan. Employment commitments None (0 hours) 1–10 hours/week 11–20 hours/week 21–30 hours/week 31+ hours/week Regular non-academic responsibilities (Extracurriculars: “Do you participate in clubs, sports, volunteering? If yes, approximate weekly time.”/Family/caregiving: “Do you have regular caregiving duties? If yes, approximate weekly hours.”/Health/needs: “Do you have regular appointments or routines (e.g., therapy, medical, self-care) that take time weekly?”) None (0 hours) 1–5 hours/week 6–10 hours/week 11+ hours/week Daily/weekly commuting No commute (0 hours) <30 minutes per day (approx. 1–2 hours/week) 30–60 minutes per day (approx. 3–6 hours/week) More than 60 minutes per day (approx. 6–12 hours/week) Access to technology and connectivity (treat as non-hour impacts; keep for advisory clarity) Reliable computer and internet (0 hours) Occasional access issues (1–3 hours/week impact) Frequent access issues (4–8 hours/week impact) Audience: Advisors self-care) that take time weekly?” with ranges. How these map to course load Each 4-unit course equates to approximately 12 hours of total work per week (class time plus study/l labs, etc.). Sum the weekly hours from all non-academic responsibilities to get total non-academic commitment. Subtract this total from a chosen weekly availability target (e.g., a common target like 40 hours total time budget, or a university-defined study-cap) to determine the maximum number of courses that can be reasonably taken. Example rule: Available study hours = Target weekly hours for academics minus non-academic commitments. Then maximum courses = floor( Available study hours / 12 ). Apply a practical cap based on institutional guidelines or student well-being considerations. Quality and accessibility considerations Allow an “uncertainties” option for time blocks that may change (e.g., seasonal jobs, family obligations). Include a brief note stating that the purpose of capturing these commitments is to personalize course loads and that schedules can be adjusted as life circumstances evolve. Ensure the language is inclusive and non-judgmental, recognizing that various responsibilities reflect a student’s lived reality.
